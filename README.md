# Odin-Landing-Page

This is my second project for the Odin Curriculum. The objective is to create a landing page using what I learnt until now. For the project I will be using HTML, CSS and practice with Flexbox.
In the beginning, I will only try to make the landing page as close as possible to the image we were given. When completed, I will customize it and give it a more personal touch.
